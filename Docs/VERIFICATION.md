# Verification notes

## Previously verified

- Manual rolls and pinned-idea branching successfully generated concepts locally.
- The model service stopped after generation.
- Theme change preserved all existing UI DOM hooks and left browser behavior unchanged.
- Original theme backup matched the original interface files.

## Folder consolidation checks

Passed during consolidation on October 6, 2026:

- Compared the copied core, engine, server, interface files, and library with the retained originals: exact matches.
- Parsed the copied library: 42 concepts and 3 pins preserved.
- Ran Node syntax checks for server, core, engine, and browser behavior: passed.
- Redirected the desktop shortcut, desktop folder launcher, and old app launchers to this project.
- Started the server with its command line and working directory pointing to this project's `local-muse` directory.
- Loaded state and interface over localhost: 42 concepts, 3 pins, centered dark interface.
- Confirmed the model service remained stopped; no generation was triggered.

Folder consolidation does not need a fresh generation request. Its verification concerns paths, preserved data, and server startup. Follow-up hands-on checks: open Start Muse.cmd, browse Pinned and Saved library, and create a Codex kit.

Keep future check results specific: record what ran, its outcome, and remaining limitations rather than treating prior checks as proof of new changes.
